We take pride in our legacy as a climate leader, and we’re committed to driving positive change for the future. The AI for Climate Resilience Program will support pioneering projects that harness artificial intelligence to help climate-vulnerable communities adapt and thrive.\n\nThis is technology in service of both people and the planet.\n\nThis program will support local, practical, and community-owned solutions. From strengthening food security and improving health systems to building coastal resilience in the face of climate change.\n\nWhat’s on offer:\n💸 Grants of up to $300,000\n🧑‍🎓 Mentorship, training, and a supportive community of practice\n\nWe encourage applications from organizations working to reduce vulnerability of local communities to climate-related risks in low- and middle-income countries. We welcome early stage applications as well, from teams that need support in developing technical details further.
